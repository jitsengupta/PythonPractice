"""
practice5.py - This is our final practice file. We are
going to build a simple guessing game here. The computer
randomly selects a number between 0 and 100 (or a range
provided as a parameter), then repeatedly asks the user
to guess the number. If the user guess is too high, the
program says that it is too high. If the user guess is
too low, it responds appropriately. If the user guesses
correctly, it will then congratulate and let the user
know how many attempts it took for the user to guess it.

You can start with the Game class in Practice4.
What attributes should this class need?

In the main part of the app, ask the user repeatedly
to enter a number. Then respond saying if the number
is higher or lower than the stored number.

Quit the program when the user types in a negative number.
You can report how many tries before the user quit, and
what the number was that the program thought of.
