"""
practice4.py - We are going to build a little game
today in the final practice app, but before we go there,
let's do something simple.

Create a Game class, similar to the class before, but
this class has a number instead of a name

In the main part of the app, ask the user repeatedly
to enter a number. Then respond saying if the number
is higher or lower than, a randomly generated number

Make this application as Object-oriented as you can.
Create the game class with the number 100 (or have the game class
randomly generate a number if no number is specified)

Have a method in the game class that makes the decision
about higher or lower and print the info.

Quit the program when the user types in a negative number.
