# practice1.py - create a simple class and constructor
# Add a default value to the constructor
# Add a __str__ method to create a string version of the class

"""
A simple 2 method class - almost all classes should have
these two methods - a constructor and a string converter
that allows you to print this class with some meaningful
information - useful for debugging
"""

class SomeClass:
    # Remove this and the next line once you create the methods
    pass

    """
    A constructor (__init__) for our class - feel free to change the name
    above. Say this class takes a name parameter and sets it to
    its attribute. Can you set a default value of the name if
    no attribute is passed?
    """
        
        
    """
    A string converter (__str__) for our class. Get this method
    to return a string of the form "My name is [name attribute]"

"""
This should be in your file. You can actually have this in every
Python file you create - gives you a simple way to test out the stuff
in this file (or anything thi sfile imports
